2. Nondeterministic finite automaton

The program automaton-p.py simulates the running of a simple non-deterministic finite automaton.
Download the program and run it with the command
python3 automaton.py word
	
where word is the word you want to recognize.

The program uses the built-in set functions to keep records of the currently available states in the computing tree of the non-deterministic finite automaton.
Draw the automaton and explain it with your own words: (1) how does the program simulate the operation of the automaton, (2) what language does the automaton recognize? (You do not need to hand in this; it is only for practicing.)
Change the description of the automaton in the file automaton-p.py between the lines
# START
	
and

# STOP
	
so that the program accepts the words that contain even number of letters a or contain the string algp (or both)!

So e.g. 'aaalgprbbb' and 'asdaefaa' are accepted but 'aaalgbb' is not.
